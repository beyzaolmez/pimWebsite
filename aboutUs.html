				A.I. P.I.M. was created to make learning Dutch easy and interactive for international students arriving to the Netherlands. 
			</p> 
			<p>
				You receive a spoken translation in real time of the text or speech inputted.

			The voice of P.I.M is a synthesized voice from a real Dutch person so it helps with listening as you get used to the Dutch accent. 
		</p>

	<p id="paragraphOne"> 
		As your Dutch level improves, the translations will be given with more complex and sophisticated vocabulary so that you can improve your Dutch vocabulary and maintain more complex and real life like conversations.

	<h2> Why A.I. P.I.M.? </h2>
	<p class="paragraphTwo"> 
		Traditional translators can often be boring and feel disconnected from the language-learning experience. With a personalized translator that has a sense of personality, users can have a more engaging and enjoyable learning experience that can help them stay motivated to learn the language.
	</p> 
	<p class="paragraphTwo">
		The project does not involve any form of commercialization or profit-making, so users can access this tool for free without any hidden costs.
